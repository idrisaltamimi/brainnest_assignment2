        swordsman with no desire other than to become "Invincible Under the
        Heavens" to an enlightened warrior who slowly learns of the importance
        of close friends, self-reflection, and life itself.

        As the 20th century approaches its end, people all over the world are anxious
        that the world is changing. And probably not for the better. Kenji Endo is a
        normal convenience store manager who's just trying to get by. But when he
        learns that one of his old friends going by the name "Donkey" has suddenly
        committed suicide, and that a new cult led by a figure known as "Friend"
        is becoming more notorious, Kenji starts to feel that something isn't right.
        With a few key clues left behind by his deceased friend, Kenji realizes that
        this cult is much more than he ever thought it would be—not only is this mysterious
        organization directly targeting him and his childhood friends, but the whole
        world also faces a grave danger that only the friends have the key to stop.
