        Aloy is cast out from the Nora tribe at birth and raised by a fellow
        outcast named Rost. As a child, Aloy obtains a Focus, an augmented
        reality device that gives her special perceptive abilities. Aloy
        becomes curious about her origins and is told by Rost that if she
        wins the Proving, a competition to earn the right to become a member
        of the Nora, the tribe's Matriarchs might concede this information.
        Aloy spends some years training in combat and survival under Rost's
        instruction.
